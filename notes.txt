1) order for service tasks: installation -> configuration -> run

2) The tasks in handler are executed in the order they're written in the file, even if you call them
with a different order

4) Every time you setup a new service verify it with the protocol explained here: 
    https://github.com/romankuchin/ica0002-2023/tree/main/03-web-server#task-4-manage-uwsgi-service

12) EXAMPLE
- name: Copy uwsgi configuration for agama
  ansible.builtin.template:
    src: ../templates/agama.ini.j2
    dest: /etc/uwsgi/apps-enabled/agama.ini
    owner: agama
    mode: '0600'
  no_log: true

name, ansible and no_log are parameters, while src, dest, owner and mode are modules

### GRAFANA SETUP ###
[security]
admin_password = {{ grafana_admin_password }}

[server]
root_url= {{ public_url }}/grafana/
serve_from_sub_path = true
### END GRAFANA SETUP ###

default grafana user - passoword: admin - admin

QUESTIONS TO PROFESSOR:
  - why should we use a global file for all the variables?
  - src: prometheus.yaml.j2: why here I don't have to specify the relative path?
  - I have to restart the grafana-server manually
