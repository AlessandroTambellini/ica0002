1) order for service tasks: installation -> configuration -> run, but there are some tricky situations

2) The tasks in handler are executed in the order they're written in the file, even if you call them
in a different order

4) Every time you setup a new service verify it with the protocol explained here: 
    https://github.com/romankuchin/ica0002-2023/tree/main/03-web-server#task-4-manage-uwsgi-service

12) EXAMPLE
- name: uwsgi configuration for agama
  ansible.builtin.template:
    src: ../templates/agama.ini.j2
    dest: /etc/uwsgi/apps-enabled/agama.ini
    owner: agama
    mode: '0600'
  no_log: true

13) default mode in ubuntu is 0644, so no need to specify it

name, ansible and no_log are parameters, while src, dest, owner and mode are modules

default grafana user - passoword: admin - admin

grep -R "src:.*\.\."

QUESTIONS TO PROFESSOR:
  - do I need to create the dashboard manually to then export the JSON file?
  - What is GH username in lab 7?
  - grafana failed here:
    - name: Add key from file
    ansible.builtin.apt_key:
      url: https://apt.grafana.com/gpg.key
      state: present
