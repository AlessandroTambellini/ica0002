1) order for service tasks: installation -> configuration -> run

2) The tasks in handler are executed in the order they're written in the file, even if you call them
in a different order

4) Every time you setup a new service verify it with the protocol explained here:

12) EXAMPLE
- name: Copy uwsgi configuration for agama
  ansible.builtin.template:
    src: ../templates/agama.ini.j2
    dest: /etc/uwsgi/apps-enabled/agama.ini
    owner: agama
    mode: '0600'
  no_log: true

name, ansible and no_log are parameters, while src, dest, owner and mode are modules

default grafana user - passoword: admin - admin

QUESTIONS TO PROFESSOR:
  - prometheus-nginx-exporter is green at the third run
  - I have to restart the grafana-server manually
  - should grafana and prometheus run on a different server?
  - do I need to create the dashboard manually to then export the JSON file?
