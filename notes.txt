1) The tasks in handler are executed in the order they're written in the file, even if you call them
in a different order

2) default mode in ubuntu is 0644, so no need to specify it

3) logs -> rsyslog (collects and send over UDP) --> 
    telegraf (collects in a nice format and send) --> 
      influxdb (store) --> 
        grafana (show nicely)

4) 
  Init is a prerequisite to install and configure Bind -->
    Bind is prerequisite to install and configure Resolver -->
      Resolver is prerequisite for any further actions with your setup.

5) WSGI stands for "Web Server Gateway Interface".
It is used to forward requests from a web server (such as Apache or NGINX) 
to a backend Python web application or framework. 
Because nginx and python app do not speak a common language, we do: 
client --> nginx --> uwsgi --> python app
  
6) IPs are allowed just in bind and keepalived

QUESTIONS TO PROFESSOR:
- which keepalived-exporter to use? from github or from backup server?
