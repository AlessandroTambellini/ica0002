1) The tasks in handler are executed in the order they're written in the file, even if you call them
in a different order

3) default mode in ubuntu is 0644, so no need to specify it

4) rsyslog is installed in ubuntu by default, so no need to install it.

5) logs -> rsyslog (collects and send over UDP) --> telegraf (nice format and send) --> influxdb (store) --> grafana (show nicely)

6) telegraf behaves like an exporter and collects the data about the service 
  specified in the config file and send to influxdb, inside the specified database

7) 
  Init is a prerequisite to install and configure Bind -->
  Bind is prerequisite to install and configure resolver -->
  Resolver is prerequisite for any further actions with your setup.

8) WSGI stands for "Web Server Gateway Interface".
It is used to forward requests from a web server (such as Apache or NGINX) 
to a backend Python web application or framework. 
Because nginx and python app do not speak a common language
==> client --> nginx --> uwsgi --> python app

9) IPs are allowed just in bind and keepalived

# LAB 13 QUESTIONS
#

- on which server do I need to install haproxy?
- "server agama1 alessandrotambellini-1:8001 check" I think the name "agama1" can be random. 
  It means I could write c1 (container1) instead of agama1
- "Port should be 88 because our NAT is configured to forward all ..." What is NAT?

    stats enable
    stats uri /stats
    stats refresh 5s

- install keepalived on both vms. 1 active and 1 in stand-by

QUESTIONS TO PROFESSOR:
  - - name: Grafana Docker container: fails at first try
  - probably I need to change DNS db.rabix.io --> ask to professor
      
BACKUP COMMANDS
// test influxdb dumps
sudo -u backup influxd backup -portable /tmp; echo $?

// SQL INJECTION
1) UNSAFE
String query = "SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = '"+ input + "'";
Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(query);

2) SAFE
PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = ?");
statement.setString(1, input);
ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery();

3) check this page to avoid SQL injections: https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1/guides/write_data/

4) chatgpt solution
  # Assuming db_url, db_name, and result are already defined properly
  encoded_db_name=$(printf %s "$db_name" | jq -s -R -r @uri)
  encoded_result=$(printf %s "$result" | jq -s -R -r @uri)

  curl -i -XPOST "${db_url}/write?db=$encoded_db_name" --data-binary "$encoded_result"
