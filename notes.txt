1) order for service tasks: installation -> configuration -> run, but there are some tricky situations

2) The tasks in handler are executed in the order they're written in the file, even if you call them
in a different order

3) Every time you setup a new service verify it with the protocol explained here: 
    https://github.com/romankuchin/ica0002-2023/tree/main/03-web-server#task-4-manage-uwsgi-service

4) EXAMPLE
- name: uwsgi configuration for agama
  ansible.builtin.template:
    src: ../templates/agama.ini.j2
    dest: /etc/uwsgi/apps-enabled/agama.ini
    owner: agama
    mode: '0600'
  no_log: true

name, ansible and no_log are parameters, while src, dest, owner and mode are modules

5) default mode in ubuntu is 0644, so no need to specify it

6) rsyslog is installed in ubuntu by default, so no need to install it.

7) logs -> rsyslog (collects and send over UDP) --> telegraf (nice format and send) --> influxdb (store) --> grafana (show nicely)

8) by default telegraf behaves like an exporter and collects the data specified in the default config file,
and, also by default, it send the data to influxdb

QUESTIONS TO PROFESSOR:
  - What is GH username in lab 7?
  - Should I be logged in automatically in grafana when entering the URL?
  - Should all exporter be run by user prometheus? Should I create a general exporter_user=prometheus in all.yaml?
